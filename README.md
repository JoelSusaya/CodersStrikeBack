# Coders Strike Back

## Overview

This project contains my code for the [Coders Strike Back](https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/coders-strike-back) competition on codingame.com. Everything was originally wrote in JavaScript and
has now been converted to TypeScript.

### TODO

* Move CodingGame class to its own module
* Remove unnecessary getters, setters, and private variables
* Rewrite code to take advantage of more of TypeScripts features (interfaces,
  mixins, modules)
